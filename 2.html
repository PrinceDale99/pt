<p>Even small increases in <em>Earth's</em> temperature caused by climate change can have severe effects. The <mark>earth's</mark> average temperature has gone 1.4°F over the past century and is expected to rise as much as 11.5 °F over the next. That might seem like a lot, but the average temperature during the last Ice Age was about 4°F lower than it is today.</p>
